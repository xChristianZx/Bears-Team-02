/* 
    * This will be the initial User model for each user profile.  In Mongoose, we use Schemas
    * to create Documents (MongoDB term) to add to our Collection.  In this case a 'Collection of Users.'
    * Most of the userSchema should be rather self-explanatory,
    * but do note the isTechnical is how we will denote a "Technical Founder" if true vs 
    * 'Non-Technical' if false.  userPhotoURL will ideally be provided via the user's profile from OAuth.
    *
    * Also note, the 'connections' will be an array of Users that maps to each unique ObjectID that 
    * MongoDB automatically creates upon each new model/Schema that is created.
    *
    * Line 30 is where most of Mongoose's magic happens, where we add it to the 
    * mongoose .model constructor, which will allow us to reference the User collection 
    * (via the module.exports = User statement)
    * throughout our Express server/ router where we can search/query the collection, create new
    * user models (create new Users), and manipulate the db as we need.
